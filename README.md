# BSH
Rain World utility mod. Adds several PlacedObject types and minor tweaks, focused entirely on shelters and sleep mechanic.


**Requirements**: EnumExtender by the mighty Bee (:tuch:), ConfigMachine by Topicular (also :tuch:).

**Installation process**: similar to any other partiality mod.

**FEATURES**:

New PlacedObject types:

**ShelterSpawnPoint**: changes player spawn and creature realization position to the specified tile. Recommended to place right above a surface so that slugcat wakes up in proper position.
**ShelterDoorShift**: moves around and rotates ShelterDoor. Should be safe to use near room borders.
**FakeDoor**: adds new shelter doors that look, sound and function identical to the usual one.

All three require room reload in order to function.


**Config**: configured as any other CM-supporting partiality mod. Option descriptions are self-explanatory.

**Bugfix**: prevents a rare vanilla bug that would occur if a player got dragged into a shelter by a hostile creature (used to permanently mess up some spawns in the save). Now the shelters won't close if you're being held by something.
